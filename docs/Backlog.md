## How stories and work items are recorded in the backlog

What the process for this is.
[]: # - How are stories and work items prioritized? Each item in the backlog has a field to represent priority. Field inputs are "low", "medium", or "high"
[]: # - How are stories and work items estimated? Each item has a field called points (1-3) where the lower the number, the easier/quicker it should be to finish
[]: # - How are stories and work items assigned to team members? For now we are doing first come first serve
[]: # - How are stories and work items tracked? Each item has a status representing how far along it is in its completion. Todo, In Progress, and Done are the options.
[]: # - How are stories and work items reported on? During weekly meetings we bring up retrospectives on completed and inprogress work items.
[]: # - How are stories and work items archived? Once an item is marked as Done, we consider it archived.
