# Product Owner for Client Meetings
How is the product owner designated for the first client meetings? is it permanent or rotated? Who is it for each team in the tribe

We rotate product owners weekly. We have 2 product owners, 1 for each group within the tribe. The groups decide amongst themselves who 
will be product owner for that week. Week 1 Product Owners: Anthony Milas, Coel Morcott. Weeks 2-5: TBD.

# Team Coordination within the tribe

How are issues between teams within the tribe raised?
Every week when we meet we do a reflection and evaluation where be bring up concerns and address areas for improvement.

What is the forum for discussion of issues between the teams?
We have a slack channel where we can bring up any issues. We also have a recurring team meeting where issues can be addressed.

When does that happen?  Who is required to be present?
That happens weekly. At least 1 person from each group within the tribe is required to be present. We fill out a when2meet to try
to organize a time that works for the most amount of people. It is unlikely that all 10 members of the tribe will be available at the same time.


# Team Communication

What is the principal way to communicate between tribes? email? discord? slack? message group?  What is the address or way to join this method of communication?

Our principle way to communicate is via slack. We sent out slack invites to everyone in our tribe. Everyone has accepted and joined our slack.

# Client Meeting Time

When is the client meeting each week? Is it static or does it move? who is responsible for coordinating with the client?

We do not have a set client meeting time for each week, but we are meeting for the first time on 5/7 (Thursday) in the afternoon.
It is possible that this will be our recurring client meeting, but it will likely shift due to varying client availability.
For this week, Coel Morcott and Anthony Milas are responsible for communicating with the client. We are considering making it the product owner's
responsibility to communcate with the client each week.
