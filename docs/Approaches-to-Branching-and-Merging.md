# Approaches to Branching and Merging

- How long should a branch live?
  Branches should be tightly scoped based off what the dev is trying to implement. These should not be massive developments, but shorter iterations. As soon as funcationality is achieved   and someone checks the work over, the branch should be merged and killed. 
  
- What is the process for merging?
  Once the feature is completed, have someone else review the code if possible. Then merge to most up to date branch. 
  
- Will your tribe use pull requests?
  Yes, this will help in multiple areas. It will allow the code base to not be iterated on too quickly, a second set of eyes before merging, and an inherent organizaiton. 

- What are the naming conventions for branches?
  Branch names should specifically reflect what feature/area is being addressed. E.g. if the branch is dedicated to logging in, an appropriate name would be logging-in-functionality.
